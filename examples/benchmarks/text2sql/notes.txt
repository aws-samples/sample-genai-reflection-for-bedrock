Overview:
This was implemented with v0.2.0 of the library,
leveraging a single 'anthropic.claude-3-sonnet-20240229-v1:0' model
and multiple rounds of self-reflection on the answers
with the use of a verifier which ran the code and provided feedback

Data:
The data was a collection of tables from the spider benchmark and evaluation
The metric used was the exact match of the generated SQL to the ground truth but we also looked at matching the expected output via different code.
